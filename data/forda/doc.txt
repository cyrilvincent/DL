FordA
TimeSeries Classification
This data was originally used in a competition in the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence, 2008.
The classification problem is to diagnose whether a certain symptom exists or does not exist in an automotive subsystem.
Each case consists of 500 measurements of engine noise and a classification.
There are two separate problems: For FordA the Train and test data set were collected in typical operating conditions, with minimal noise contamination
